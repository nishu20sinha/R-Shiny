## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following R packages installed:

```R
install.packages(c("shiny", "ggplot2", "forecast", "zoo", 
                   "dplyr", "lubridate", "readr", "rugarch"))
```

### Run the App Locally

Clone this repo and run the app from your R environment:

```R
library(shiny)
runApp("path/to/your/cloned/folder")
```

Or simply open `app.R` and click **Run App** in RStudio.

## 📂 File Upload Format

Your CSV file should have at least:
- A **date column** (e.g., `2023-01`, `01/01/2022`, `Jan-2022`, etc.)
- One or more **numeric value columns**

The app automatically detects the date format and parses it accordingly.
